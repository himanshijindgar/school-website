We laid the foundation stone of Nehru International Public School(NIPS) as a small first step towards
 providing a sound base for a child’s future, and the fulfillment of the dreams and aspirations of
 parents.<br>
At NIPS, Noida, we ensure that those in our care are given every opportunity to develop into good
 human beings.<br>
We are fully conscious that no responsibility is of a higher magnitude in exaltation or nobler than
 nurturing a juvenile mind and directing it towards the pursuit of excellence, with the power to
 shape its own destiny.<br>
We would like our students to develop an open mind with a worldview that is deeply rooted in Indian
 heritage and tradition. We would like them to imbibe the values of those who shaped the nation, and
 above all, the noble sanskars: of nationalism, compassion and love for the less privileged.<br>
 
At the same time, to keep pace with the speed of development, we will open newer and newer fields 
of knowledge to prepare our students for the future. We are focussing on the holistic, all round 
development of every child to enable each to confidently face the challenges of life ahead.<br>
